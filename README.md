# 🎬 K-Drama SQL Database Project

A relational database built to organize and analyze data about the **Top 250 Korean Dramas**, including cast, genres, networks, ratings, and more. This project combines real-world data modeling, SQL querying, and entity relationship design using **MySQL Workbench** and **SQL scripts**.
---

## 📍 Overview

This project focuses on building a **fully normalized SQL database** from scratch using a dataset of Korean dramas collected from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahbab911/top-250-korean-dramas-kdrama-dataset. The goal was to structure unorganized tabular data into a relational model that could answer **real-world business or entertainment-focused questions**, such as:

- What are the highest-rated dramas?
- Which genres are most common?
- Which actors appear in the most popular dramas?
- Which networks produce the top-performing series?

The database was designed in **MySQL Workbench (.mwb)**, with schema exported as `.sql`, and includes a range of practical queries for exploration and analysis.

> 🔐 **Note:** Some production company names and cast data were abbreviated or simulated to maintain formatting and avoid ambiguity in parsing.
